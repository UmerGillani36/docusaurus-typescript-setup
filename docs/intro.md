# Introducing Video Generation Made Easy

With our video generation script, you can effortlessly create stunning video shorts in a matter of seconds. The process is simple and highly customizable, allowing you to tailor your videos to suit your specific needs and style.

## Key Features

### Simple JSON Configuration

Using a JSON file, you can easily specify the properties of your video, including its title, dimensions, frames per second, and background color. This gives you full control over the look and feel of your video.

### Scene Management

Our script supports multiple scenes, each with its own duration and transition effects. You can smoothly transition between scenes, creating engaging visual experiences.

### Diverse Element Types

Our script offers a wide range of element types to choose from, including videos, images, text, audio, albums, and more. You can mix and match these elements to create captivating narratives.

### Dynamic Elements

Want to add a touch of interactivity to your videos? Our script supports dynamic elements such as dynamic images and videos, which allow you to dynamically change content during playback.

### HTML Elements

Customize your videos further by incorporating HTML elements. You can easily embed HTML code, such as headings, paragraphs, or even interactive components, to enhance your videos with rich visuals and interactive elements.

### Audio Integration

Seamlessly incorporate background audio into your videos to enhance the overall experience. You have the flexibility to choose whether individual elements should include audio or not.

### Fine-Grained Control

With the ability to set start and end times for videos, loop properties, and element positions, you have precise control over every aspect of your video's composition.

### Error Handling and Progress Tracking

Our script provides error handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth video creation process. Additionally, you can track the progress of video generation, allowing you to monitor the status and make adjustments if needed.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
